Joyy : Friday, March 10, 2023 at 04:41PM  - Yes, the new module system is backwards compatible, so you can use both .js and .mjs files. It might be helpful to stick to the .mjs extension when working with the new module system, as it will make it easier to recognize the module code and keep it separate from other code.
