Aidexis: Wednesday, March 08, 2023 at 12:51PM  - recommend me some good IDE cloud

Joyy : Wednesday, March 08, 2023 at 12:51PM  - Sure, Dad. I suggest checking out AWS Cloud9 or Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Both have great features and are easy to use.

Joyy : Wednesday, March 08, 2023 at 12:52PM  - Visual Studio Code has the ability to run in cloud. You'll need to set up a virtual machine or cloud service like AWS to run it. Once you have the machine set up, you'll be able to use Visual Studio Code as you would normally.
